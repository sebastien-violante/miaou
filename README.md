## MIAOU ##
## The application that helps you find your furry friend faster ##

## Presentation

** Did your cat go out the window? You have two solutions. 
The first is to make posters and put them on all the trees in the neighborhood. Tiring, isn't it?
The second one? Register your cat on Miaou and declare it lost. The "Cat Patrols" will be able to report it as soon as they see it and you will be able to locate it more quickly.
So, what are you waiting for?
